<p>Having been in cayons for the lats few days I decided it was time for some serious work. The Sandstone Peak Loop of 6 miles and an elevation of 1300 feet seemed a good choice. Sandstone Peak is the highest mountain within the Santa Monica Mountains. The peak is located in the middle of what's called Circle X Ranch. It is an hour ride from Hollywood and the last miles of Yerba Buena Road winds itselfs around rough rock formations and beatifull views to the Mishe Mokwa Trail head.</p><p>After a mile into the walk the balanced rock comes into view. It is not hard to recognize and it doesn't need a lot of imagination to understand why it is named that way.</p><p><img src="/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/rene.src/br_5F00_sml.jpg" /></p><p>The lunch stop was at split rock. From this point onwards no more shady bits, just open wilderness. The factor 30 sunmilk is used a lot. The hike continuous to reach Backbone trail just below a few giant watertanks. From there I reached the first goal of this days hike: Inspiration Point.</p><p><img src="/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/rene.src/ip_5F00_sml.jpg" /></p><p>This point is just on 2800 feet elevation.</p><p>The last stretch brings me to the small path that heads up to Sandstone peak and brings me to the highest point in the hike, 3111 feet. The last few feet require some mountaineering but the views are more than worth it.</p><p><img src="/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/rene.src/ma_5F00_sml.jpg" /></p><p>I'm not sure if you can read the plaquette but it states 'Mt. Allen'. The fact is that it is also Sandstone Peak. Names doesn't tell it all though. This rock is not from Sandstone, it is some volcanic rock, very, very hard. Looking around gives you views on the ocean, the LA bassin (smoggy) and the San Gabriel Mountains. When the body and mind is focussed again for finishing this hike I head downhill to reach the car on the exact spot I left it.</p><p>Encountered species:
