<p>I posted earlier about threat modelling</p><p>Here is a tool form MS. <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=62830f95-0e61-4f87-88a6-e7c663444ac1&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank">Threat Model tool</a></p><p>I installed it and indeed there is a place where I actually model with DFD's ... Still feel that I'm better of putting this in an seqeunce diagram</p>
