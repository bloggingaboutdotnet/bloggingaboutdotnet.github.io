<p>This was about to happen. Naturally when you are in LA, in West Hollywood you have to visit Mount Hollywood (or Mount Lee if you're only for the sign in LA). But before I set off I had to pack my stuff and say goodbye to my B&amp;B. It worked out like I hoped for, an laid-back approach, good room, great breakfast, good location for getting around in LA.</p><p><img src="/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/rene.src/bb_5F00_sml.jpg" /></p><p>To start the walk (rather not call it a hike) I parked in griffith park and from there I headed for the observatory strangely enough named after the Park. The observatory is located on a nice hillside which is reachable just under 30 minutes. Over there you find out that you could also have taken the car to get in front of the observatory.</p><p><img src="/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/rene.src/go2_5F00_sml.jpg" /></p><p>From the observatory to head for Mount Hollywood but before that take a 'I was here picture' from the hollywood sign because on top of Mount Hollywood the angle for viewing the sign is not well.

That a fire road is needed becomes clear as you are actually walking across an area that has been recently hit by brush fire. There are no trees or other shady bits so make sure you are in enough supply of water and sunblock. After a 30 minutes uphill hike you reach the top where you are met with some nice overviews of the LA-bassin and thr surrounding mountains.
