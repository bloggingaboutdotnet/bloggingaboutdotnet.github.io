<p>I'm not sure what happened with my company laptop still running Windows XP but it is clear that something is going wrong.</p><p><a href="http://bloggingabout.net/blogs/rene/Image/livemsg.GIF" class="" target="_blank"><img src="http://bloggingabout.net/blogs/rene/Image/livemsg.GIF" style="WIDTH: 250px; HEIGHT: 250px" height="250" align="left" width="250" /></a></p><p>This screenshot is NOT manipulated. Actually the 'we need to close' box shows first. Then the main Live Messenger window show and I can start a conversation. As long as I don't click 'Send error report' or 'Don't Send' everything works fine. As soon as I do click any button party is over and I have to restart Messenger.</p><p>I'm also very sorry for the inconvenience....</p><p>;-)</p>
