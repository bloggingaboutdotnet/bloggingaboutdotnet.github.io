<p>Raymond Chen is the guy who makes Windows work.... In this <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/07/09/178342.aspx" target="_blank">blog</a> he explains some of the innerworkings of Add/Remove Programs (you know in Control Panel) . Just read-it and read all the comments. Great stuff ;-)</p>
