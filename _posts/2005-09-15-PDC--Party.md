It is nice to be at PDC and sit and listen to all those great developers and program managers to tell about their products. But on wednesday the fun was over.</p><p>7000 PDC participants where directed to not too many buses and transported over totally congested freeways (funny name) to a theme park called Universal Studio. it was so Universal that it looked like the Efteling but than smaller.</p><p>We were greeted by a mexican dance- and fire-eater act. After that we proceeded to the Frankestein walk-through ghost house. Some mentally ill americans jumped from behind walls to scare the shit out of us, which went very well.</p><p>After that we had to wait for 5 minutes to get in the Terminator 2D-3D theatre. After the theatre was pumped full with mist we were presented a sort of unrealistic movie. I didn't get where all the fuss was about but that might be caused by my lack of understanding the english language.</p><p>When we left the theatre we headed for a restaurant where we had a 3 course meal (French Fries, Hamburger, Coke).</p><p>The queue for an animated presentation of a Shrek was a moderate (about 10 minutes) wait. Here the crowd was sprayed with water. The same happened in a presentation called Waterworld. On the billboards the show was rated as #1 in the World. In real some actors performed some stunts with boats and pyro-technincs. They even simulated a plain crash. It didn't impressed me because it wasn't a real plane.</p><p>Finally we had to take a ride in a car, a DeLorean. I don't like convertibles and this car had a special lousy suspension so the guy in the front-seat had to puke.</p><p>Luckily at 11:00 pm the ordeal was over and Rob, Erwyn and myself could finally get to our hotels.</p><p>If you ever happen to come to a Microsoft Conference, skip the party.
