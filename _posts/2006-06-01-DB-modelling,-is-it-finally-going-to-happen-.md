<p>It was (and is) so easy. Every single soul at Microsoft considered it best practise to directly connect to a database, bring table and columns names right up to the GUI layer, have a framework that mimics your database in memory (and every dev always try to load the whole database into memory).</p><p>Strange thing was however that the Visual Studio IDE always lacked any descent support for database modelling. I have tried Visual Modeller (in the VB6 era) but that didn't made me happy. The usage of Visio doesn't need to discussed here I guess. You always had to fallback to other very good tools like <a href="http://www.sybase.com/products/developmentintegration/powerdesigner" target="_blank">PowerDesigner</a> (Sybase) or ErWin. Also Enterprise Architect is good rated.</p><p>Now it looks like Microsoft is striking back. The Visual Studio team System for <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/teamsystem/products/dbpro/">DateBase professionals</a>. That looks promising. Can't wait till June, 11th for giving that tool a test-drive.</p><p>[UPDATE]: download <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/1/a/3/1a32ea84-11a3-4adf-953e-7a65b9831f5a/VSDATAD1.img">here.</a></p>
