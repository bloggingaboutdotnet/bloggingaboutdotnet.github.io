<p>Infected by <a href="http://www.robvonk.com">Rob Vonk</a> I did buy a Palm Vx 5 years ago. A Palm Vx uses a modest 512 Kb of memory for running Palm OS 4, an OS which has one single purpose: run very, very well on an handheld device. The Vx had a stunning 8Mb at that time.</p><p>Jalouzy came sometimes to mind when I saw people walking around with brand new iPaq with a zillion colours and Microsoft CE, with a user interface familiar to the desktop. But somehow I always sticked with my dating but still functioning very well Palm.</p><p>But now Bill again changed everything. The unthinkable happened: <a href="http://www.palm.com/us/company/?intcmp=HmPg_Windows_20050926">Palm</a> and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/5/palm.mspx">Microsoft</a> joined forces and in january 2006 Palm will launch the new Palm Treo which will run Windows Mobile 5.0.</p><p>That IS the best of both worlds. I can stick with my Palm to keep Rob happy and run Windows Mobile to keep Bill happy. And if Rob and Bill are happy: I'm happy.</p>
