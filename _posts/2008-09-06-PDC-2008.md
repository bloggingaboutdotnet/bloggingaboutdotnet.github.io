<p>It is al in the pocket now. I'm going (again) to the PDC in LA. To get final approval the signatures of three managers were needed and the team secretary was kind enough to arrange my flight. As far as I know a rather large group of dutch developers and architects is heading for LA. We'll meet near the Starbuck coffee corner at the first floor.</p>
