<p>This was an astonishing presentation of WCF and WWF working together. Don and <a href="http://www.dharmashukla.com/">Dharma</a> showed how Service and Workflow come together to meet the new era of IT and business alignment.</p><p>As the Conneccted Systems Division is moving forward I already see a trend. The XAML format is not only going to be used for WPF but is a general object serialization model. But as that is not enough it also used as an exchange mechanism for sharing the meta data between workflow end-points .</p><p>Most astonishing was where Dharma showed the overcrowed room 150/151 the alteration of the workflow by browsing to the xaml endpoint file with the ?view query paremeter. There it showed the Workflow just as it was before in the VS2005 IDE and then he changed the workflow (added a step) for the running workflow instances... awesome!</p><p>And it worked.</p><p>So overall:
<br />
WCF and WWF are very, very great foundations.
<br />
XAML might be come the new 'open' standard for a lot of meta-data descriptions.
