<p>Last week I attended a private workshop at Microsoft (Building 40) together with <a href="http://www.edwardbakker.nl/PermaLink,guid,7f12fb9c-84c4-4baf-b609-c2d94b372176.aspx" target="_blank">Edward</a>.</p><p>The workshop addressed the Service Factory, which can be used in/as a Software Factory. As you might expect, the Service Factory handles much of the plumbing code needed when you create a service oriented architecture application. In the public <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/codegallery/codegallery.aspx?id=6fde9247-53a8-4879-853d-500cd2d97a83">download</a> you will find a setup that will add project templates, new menu-items, code snippets and documentation to your VS2005 environment.</p><p>During the workshop we discussed a lot of things, for example how the ASMX services and the upcoming WCF services should be supported. The service factory wil probably have a sort capability to 'convert' an existing asmx service contract to a WCF contract.</p><p>As some of us had some time to spare on friday we also had an introduction on <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/codegallery/codegallery.aspx?id=941d2228-3bb5-42fd-8004-c08595821170">Smart Client Software Factory</a>. This tooling does a lot of the plumbing for mainly the Composite UI application Block, in creating Modues, Views and Presenters.</p><p>Besides this two mentioned SF's there will be also Guidance Automation Packages for Web clients and Mobile clients.</p><p>So keep an eye on those technologies as they will add some very usefull stuff to the VS2005 experience</p>
