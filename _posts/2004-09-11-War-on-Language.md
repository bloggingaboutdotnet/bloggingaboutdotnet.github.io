<p>I waited a while before I decided that it was time to come up with a post on the War on VB/C# that is going on.
<br />
It really doesn't matter what language you use. Sometimes a customer makes a specific request and if no preference is indicated our company sticks to C#.
<br />
What is lacking in the discussion is that every developer should adhere a Coding Standard. Your company has some and there are several available on the net.
<br />
Don't have just a look on this link <a href="http://www.idesign.net/idesign/download/Idesign Csharp coding standard.zip" target="_blank" title="IDesing C-sharp">IDesign C-Sharp coding</a> or <a href="http://www.tiobe.com/standards/gemrcsharpcs.pdf" target="_blank" title="Philips">Philips Medical Systems</a> but use them/adopt them.
<br />
If you think you know better or you can relax these kind of standards, read my lips: You don't, you shouldn't!
<br />
Happy coding!</p><p>[Update: Idesign link now works]</p>
