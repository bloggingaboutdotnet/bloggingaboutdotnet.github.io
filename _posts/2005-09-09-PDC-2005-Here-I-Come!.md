<p>The last few years my manager promised to make some arrangement to get me to the PDC. Somehow it never happened.</p><p>But how different are things this year. I'm on the brink of leaving for schiphol airport together with <a href="http://www.bloggingabout.net/blogs/rob">Rob van der Meijden</a> and we will join Erwyn there.</p><p>I'm going to make an effort to keep you posted on a daily basis. If you have any special questions or even session you want me to attend, feel free to drop me a note and I will see if I can fit it in my schedule.</p><p>See you @ PDC2005</p>
