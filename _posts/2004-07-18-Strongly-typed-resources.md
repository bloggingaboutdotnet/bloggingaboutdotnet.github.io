<p>I stumbled across this <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/dotnet/ResourceClassGenerator.asp">article</a> on code project. It creates a strongly typed class which consumes your resource file (resx). As it is deployed as an custom tool it will integrate in the IDE and will re-generate your class every time you change the resx file.</p><p>I downloaded the source and made some small changes so it will fit in the current Project.</p>
