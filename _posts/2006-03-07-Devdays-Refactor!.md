<p>Today I visited the Microsoft DevDays. During our lunch-break <a href="http://www.bloggingabout.net/rob">Rob</a> and myself attended a ' commercial' session. I have to admit that I normally never go to any sessions during the lunch-break because the lunch-break is for... lunch.</p><p><img src="http://bloggingabout.net/UserFiles/Rene Schrieken/Image/cor.gif" alt="" height="290" align="left" width="368" />But as Refactoring is one of my favourite habits and I already much like the VS2005 default refactoring functionalites we stepped into the Delta room where Mark Miller presented his tool <a href="http://www.devexpress.com/Products/NET/Refactor/">Refactor!</a></p><p>During the session Rob decided to inform a member of the management commitee of our in-house Software Factory to buy some licenses for this tool. The reaction was not that enthousiastic...To work out why there were mixed feelings at buying yet another tool I created a little graph with OpenOffice and did some assumptions:</p><p>You work 200 days a year, during which you will work with 200 classes and you always need somewhere in time to refactor those.</p><p>A refactor by hand cost: 1 minute, 2 minutes or 5 minutes. That includes re-test.</p><p>The cost-rate for an average developer 30 EUR.</p><p>The license cost for Refactor! is 140 EUR.</p><p>As you can see from the graph, the break-even point for the tool is after 240 refactorings for 1 minute refactorings.</p><p>Based on my previous assumptions I now understand that it is not worth to invest in a tool where the ROI starts after a year.</p>
