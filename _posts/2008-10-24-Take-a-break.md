<p>Today no thrilling new hikes. I did get out just to get some mileage but I had to adjust my plans just as I arrived at Trippet Ranch. The area was closed because of the high danger for bush fires. So I drove to Agoura hills to walk into the Cheeseboro canyon and take it easy.</p><p><img src="/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/rene.src/rest_5F00_sml.jpg" />b</p><p>You see: all joy. Or this explains why I'm not IT's next top model.</p><p>I already told you I drive around the Los Angeles County. The lonely planet warned for the driving habbits of the LA-inhabitants but it feels not much different than in the Netherlands. You just have to watch out for at least 3 cars, the one in the front, the one in the back and the one left of you. If they don't start touching you or you don't start touching them you can continue. The only difference between here in LA and at home the cars interchange every second. Just to monitor three cars assumes you drive on the far right of the road. And that causes a bit of an issue. Because most of the time you're screwed in the right lane. Either the lane changes in a 'right lane must turn' strip in the most unexpected moments (I have a GPS in the car, it recalculates new routes very often), a parked car comes into sight or you're sandwiched between traffic leaving and entering the highway/freeway/interstate. A better choice is to keep as far left as possible (but still keep the right part of the road, you're not in Great Britain). The problem then is speeding. All cars are by definition driving to fast. And I'm not saying that I never drive too fast but I really don't want to be booked here. So I most of the time end-up somewhere in the middle of the road having to keep track of all traffic around me.</p><p>This in the VW rabbit (2.5 litres: that is far more that I have in the Netherlands in my Renault Megane, but I also had to re-fuel on tuesday, which is also far more often than in the Netherlands). Not sure about those environmental aware californians. On the other hand: they still have some things to improve their CO2 bookmark.</p><p><img src="/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/rene.src/car_5F00_sml.jpg" /></p><p>(picture taken at the car park at the Josphine Saddle Trail head)</p>
