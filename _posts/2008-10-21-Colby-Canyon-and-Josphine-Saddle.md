<p>This days hike went to the Angeles National Forest. You need a permit for parking the car so I first drove to the Los Angeles River Ranger District office to buy the permits. On my way I drove through area that was hit by the recent forest fire. It looks like a moon landscape. You realize that the warnings for the use of open fire are to be taken very serious.</p><p>In the Angeles National Forest I drove up the Angeles Crest Highway past Clear Creek junction in the hart of the San Gabriel Mountains. There the Colby Canyon trail starts. I must admit that the trail gives you the oppertunity to either climb Josephine Peak or Strawberry Peak but in the ascent to Josepehine Saddle I realized that the last few months the extra hours on the project didn't helped the stamina. I had two options: go on in a terrible slow pace and return to the car far after sunset or just enjoy the views at the Saddle and then return. The latter was the obvious choice.</p><p>To give an impression of the Colby Canyon:</p><p><img src="/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/rene.src/colby_5F00_canyon_5F00_small.jpg" /></p><p><br />
No rattlesnakes yet but the fast amount of lizards can't be missed:</p><p><img src="/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/rene.src/hagedis_5F00_sml.jpg" /></p>
