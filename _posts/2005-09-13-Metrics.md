<p>Metrics is a hot and though topic. During your projects you collect all kind of data which you then use to do some crystal bowl predictions. Based on some vague requirements you have to estimate how much time you will spend analysing, coding and testing on the a new and unknown project.</p><p>Last night I watched <a href="http://www.espn.com">ESPN</a>, the sports channel. There was a baseball game between the Mariners and another team I don't remember. Baseball isn't a sport that has a lot of supporters in the Netherlands. Nevertheless the world championships for baseball were held in the Nehterlands last week. So real baseball fans have to bare with me.</p><p>During the game you get a lot of statistics about the performance of the players. And my guess is that the coaches use those numbers to predict and steer the outcome of the game. Now that is metrics on his best.
<br /></p><p>This morning I watched the review of the last night games. They showed some footage of Barry Bonds.
<br />
Barry Bonds is a baseball player of the Giants. And they showed his metrics. One statistic struck me: Standing Ovation: 53 seconds.</p><p>That is a metric I really would like to introduce in our software development shop!
