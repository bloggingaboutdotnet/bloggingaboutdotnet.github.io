<p>As the weather is not that good I decided to pick up my FaceBook project again.
<br />
During this mini project I will use the Service Factory and the Smart Client Software Factory to get some experience, find omissions etc.
<br />
These days it is considered modern if you do Agile/TDD so I will.</p><p>First some definition:
<br />
The FaceBook is used by groups of people who needs to know each other without having the possibility to interact very often with each other.</p><p>Examples are: Colleagues in your division, Participants in a training, Members of a community.</p><p>To kick off I have dreamed up some requirements:</p><ul><li>The FaceBook is available online, offline and in hardcopy.</li><li>A FaceBook stores data of persons and their relation to each other.</li><li>From each person at least a Picture and the name is stored.</li><li>The FaceBook data is stored either in a central location or local to the user.</li><li>The central store is accessible by different clients.</li><li>The FaceBook can use existing stores of Person data.</li><li>Each Person can access/update or delete his data.</li><li>Each Person can access the to his identity published FaceBook</li><li>A Forager can change all data for a FaceBook</li><li>A Requester can access FaceBooks issued by him/her</li><li>A Requester can issue the creation of a FaceBook</li><li>A Forager can access the list of creation requests</li></ul><p>The following roles are using the FaceBook:</p><ul><li>The Requester: Person who issued the request for a FaceBook</li><li>The Forager: Person who manages/gathers the data for the requested FaceBook</li><li>The Person: Person which has to submit/update his Photo and other information</li></ul><p>Tomorrow I will post the dev schedule.</p>
