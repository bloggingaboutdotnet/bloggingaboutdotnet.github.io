<p>Late yesterday afternoon I had my first real life experience with a session on Team System (previously known as whitehorse) and I must say it looks pretty good. I will certainly try to work out how this will work in a real-life scenario. I did miss however if all this meta info is under sourcecontrol. It is some what frightning if operations start to change things during a project currently under development although it would prevent surprises during deployment.</p><p>I went to an session called ' So you THINK you know what an object is' . It was a great session from a developer point of view. The presenter skipped all slides and only demo-ed code. Unfortunately it was VB.NET code. He showed the horrors you can get yourself into if you share Vb dll' s with c# code, or when toyu byref or byval object pointers. He showed casting up and down with Ctype and showed a really horrible handling of interface references. My conclusion: Definitly stay away from VB.NET.</p><p>Remember: C++ developers are called Seep</p><p>VB.NET are called Dim</p><p>CSharp are called sharpies</p><p>Use thesaurus to see what this really mean (if you're not a native english speaker)</p>
