<p>I attended an architecture clinic with Juval Lowy in a small damp and crowed room. Juval was doing a Chalk and Talk was basically comes to the attendees explaining their business nees and Juval doing an architectural design, focussing on services, managers, engines and dataacces. He then takes all this design elements and show how they will fit in the process view, security view etc. It is great to see Juval talk and try to extract the business needs (we had some guys explaining their charity fund raising stuff and I must say Juval had a clearer understanding of what they should do then they had their self). There was one great conversation to the end of the session:</p><p>Poor Architect:" I'm the architect, I design those things and then developers start implementing and they just pass-by every layer and go directly anywhere and I tell them to stop and adhere the architecture. What do I say to those developers?"</p><p>Juval: "Do you want me to answer your developers the unpollite way or the politcal correct way?"</p><p>Poor Architect: "Uhhhmm, political correct please"</p><p>Juval: "Software development is not a democratic process"</p><p>I love it!</p>
