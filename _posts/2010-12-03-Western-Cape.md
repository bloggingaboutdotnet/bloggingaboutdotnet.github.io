<p>As hell is freezing over in western europe I felt it would be appropiate to cheer you up with a small post from Sir Lowry's Village. If you're wondering where that might be, it is just around the corner at Cape Town, South Africa. I'm staying at <a href="http://www.bezweni.co.za/" title="Bezweni lodge">Bezweni Lodge</a>, an absolute stunning place. A few reasons: The dirt road (which only adds to the growing expectations), the wide views, the lovely landlady, the scenery, the fantastic room, the wonderfull breakfast, and last but not least: Dinner!</p><p>If you are planning to visit the western cape around cape town, Sir Lowry's Pass Village is a perfect basecamp. You'll reach the main attractions easily, whether you're into hiking, tatsting, riding, diving, shopping or culture and history.</p><p>Just to give you an impression:</p><p>Sunset:</p><p><a href="/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/rene/7840.bezweni_2D00_sunset.jpg"><img src="/resized-image.ashx/__size/550x0/__key/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/rene/7840.bezweni_2D00_sunset.jpg" border="0" /></a></p><p>Fresh Seafood (not eaten by me)</p><p><a href="/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/rene/5001.fresh_2D00_greyfish.jpg"><img src="/resized-image.ashx/__size/550x0/__key/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/rene/5001.fresh_2D00_greyfish.jpg" border="0" /></a></p>
