<p>Nice session about Server Controls in ASP.NET. Knew a lot of the items shown already. The demo of the TextBox and the Validator was actually shown to me a few months ago by a colleage of mine: <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/aspnet/AspNetValidatedTextBox.asp" target="_blank" title="Drieske">Dries</a>.
<br />
I will do some hacking with this because it's still a very nice and clean way of creating maintable websites.</p>
