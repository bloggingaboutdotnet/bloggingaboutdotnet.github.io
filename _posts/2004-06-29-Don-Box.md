<p>Ok, I've attended two sessions with Don Box (<a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/dbox">http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/dbox</a>) and I must warn you guys(girls). Don is doing Questions upfront NOT on the end of the session. The first session (on hosting, app domains etc) (CTS405) this did not work very well as no one asked any questions. So Don simply walked us through the powerpoints and explained and showed usefull things about AppDomains and Hosting platforms.</p><p>Lessons Learned:</p><p>Use IIS/ ASP.NET as a host</p><p>Stay away or move away from .Net remoting and the TcpChannel and BinaryFormatter</p><p>CTS200 should address Service Orientation and the .Net developer. Here the Question trick worked very well and Don didn't touched his powerpoint sheets but answered great questions from the audience. He will answer all the questions within 48 hours in his blogs but there are a few highlights I will share here with you (i hope I don't mis quote)</p><p>.Net Remoting is reenginered DCOM in managed code. It is wonderfull but it has not a lot of usage and is onmly advisable in small projects. Performance is not as good as it should be and security is (out-of-the-box) missing. Major issue is that .Net Remoting is not a good way of implementing a SO based architecture because: for .net Remoting to work you need the .dll on both sides of the wire. And this means that it is not really messagebased.</p><p>Ok for now, going to take a snack and then a ride home.</p>
