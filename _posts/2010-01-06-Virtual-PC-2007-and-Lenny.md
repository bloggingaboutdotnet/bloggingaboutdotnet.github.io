<p>Lenny is the latest Debian release. I did build a virtual machine on my Vista 64 bits pc starting with the <a href="http://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/5.0.3/i386/iso-cd/debian-503-i386-netinst.iso">net installer cd</a>. It refused to boot but adding <a href="http://kartones.net/blogs/kartones/archive/2009/02/18/installing-debian-5-0-in-virtual-pc-2007.aspx">noapic nolapic and noreplace-paravirt</a> to the boot command did the trick. Put the vhd on the usb drive, transported it through the harse winterweather to the office. Picked a PC from the storage. It had a fresh company approved domain joined Windows XP SP2 image on it. Offcourse it was a 32 bits machine.</p><p>Installed VPC 2007 SP1, copied the VHD, created a new virtual machine, attached the vhd, booted and....</p><p>Kernel Panic - not syncing: Attempted to kill the idle task!</p><p>...just after the bootimage started.</p><p>Retried... added vga=771...added vesa... wondered if 64 bits virtual hard drives are different....googled...found remarks about faulty memory (in a vpc?). Changed to my laptop, same issue. Downloaded a fresh iso from Debian, same issue. This is driving a man crazy. It used to work....</p><p>I finally googled the address of the instrcution pointer: EIP: [&lt;c01012d0&gt;] and that brought me by the <a href="http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/5/3/60">bugs in the P2 processor</a> with regard to the i387 or floating point processor. In the kernel documentation looked up the <a href="http://www.mjmwired.net/kernel/Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt">kernel-parameters</a> and searched for any no.... regarding the fpu.</p><p>The first was <strong>no387</strong>. That did bring the boot further in the process but the Debian kernel didn't had the math emulation compiled in so that failed there</p><p>The next was <strong>nofxsr</strong>. Hurray, that worked! Debian Lenny is now working in my VPC on both Intel x64 cpu and good old Intel x32 cpu.</p><p>Lesson learned:</p><p>The cpu is not virtualized in VPC2007 (as opposed to the networkcard and video card)</p><p>Always Google for the EIP address in case of kernel panic.</p>
