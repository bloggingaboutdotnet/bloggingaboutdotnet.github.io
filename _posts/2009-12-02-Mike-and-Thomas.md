<p>I just returned from the theatre in Gouda where I watched the performance of Mike en Thomas.</p><p>These two comedians use music and slapstick in a way that makes it look easy but leaves you flabbergasted after all. How about a very jazzy song about how much Mike hates Jazz. Or the observations in the office. The guy from IT is mentioned twice and is not flattering.</p><p>If you're into comedy a must see. <a href="http://www.mikeenthomas.com/">Mike and Thomas</a> are a league on their own.</p>
