<p>I was talking to an Infrastructure Architect and it surprised me how big the GAP in the kind of knowledge is between infrastructure oriented architects and application oriented architects (I'm a liitle arrogant so I believe I'm an application architect).
<br /><br />
When the infrastructure guy takes me on tour around Active Directory I go 'huhuhuh' after two minutes and when I start elaborating about role-based security, connection pooling, OleDb, Automation they get Question Marks in their eyes.
<br /><br />
Of course it could be due to my overall lack of knowledge (and then I probably spoke to the wrong people because all of you know exactly what is going on) but as I experience it now there is a major Gap between infra and app and life would be easier if the gap closed or at least have a bridge...</p>
