<p>Ok, so I was finished at speakers talent. I didn't win.</p><p>I must admit that I picked up some nerves before but it struck me hard when I realized in the first 10 seconds of so of my 5 minutes talk that the sound system quality was so poor that nobody was going to hear me. It took me off balance for about 30 seconds, ruining the best part of my talk (which should have had two jokes in it). After that I steered smoothly to the end and the full fledged demo (TFS and VS2005, running a teambuild) did work!</p><p>Things I learned today:</p><ul><li>Check the sound system when there are enough people around</li><li>If you can present in your native language, do so.</li><li>Try to make the best of it, even you find the setting not ideal.</li></ul><p>I know by now that I need some more practice. So if anyone is interested in having a demo on TeamBuild (or Service Factory) give me call!</p><p>When time permits I will create a screencast of my presentation, afterall I have a full five minute script now!</p>
