<p>Here at TechEd it is time for the four o'clock break.</p><p>I will try to summarize the key note:</p><p>Longhorn is definitively to 2006 but luckily Yukon (SQLserver 2005) and Whidby (Visual Studio 2005) will arrive in time. It is nice to see that Microsoft is working very very hard to try to overcome the mistake they made when Bill Gates forgot to buy Rational. (I know now why they didn't, there are big holes in Rational Tools integration and Rational does have a big *nix developer crowd). Team services should compete with XDE from Rational and so far it looks like thjey have done a pretty good job (although I hope there is an option to choose for UML notation instead of those funky MS look). Still have to find out if Source Control has changed....</p><p>The home developer could be happy with the Express version of Visual Studio (or maybe for our customers who don't want to buy licenses for the whole product).</p><p>Pat Halland (GNLARC) did an intro on WebServices based on his ' metropolis' paradigm. I think it made a lot clear and gives me some guidance on how to tell managers and our customers how they should look to the concept of SOA. I didn't knew Pat was a great singer but go see the video to judge his perfromance (and that of Don Box). On wednesday the video will be online at <a href="http://www.pathelland.com">http://www.pathelland.com</a></p><p>Last session (ARC301) was about Business Alignment and SOA. A grest conceptual overview with two techniques (module maps and business event decomposition) to make it easier for IT architects and Business Analystist to make proper (business driven ? (wow!)) descission about what functionalitiy to bring to SOA (and what not). I'm eager to try this at home.</p><p>Ok, so far from TechEd</p>
