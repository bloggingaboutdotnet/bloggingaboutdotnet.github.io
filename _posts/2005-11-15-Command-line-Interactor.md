<p>I have my four minutes of fame on <a href="http://www.fourhour.net">www.fourhour.net</a>. Well I didn't stick to the script (we hadn't had one) so I talked for almost 30 minutes. Rob had to do some clipping and editing and posted my video in two parts.</p><p>Part one handles about Configuration Management with the tools from IBm Rational. For version control that is ClearCase and for ChangeManagement that will be ClearQuest. If you ever worked with one of those tools you get a love-hate relationship. The GUI for both tools is on some places...awkward... even useless. But the toolset embodies a underestimated and due to the unexperienceness of the average developer/user forever hidden features. In the video I rant on ClearCase but I hope you also encounter my passion for the power of the version control system. <a href="http://213.84.140.132/topic.aspx?id=7">Have a look your self</a>.</p><p>On the second part I zoom into a small class that unhides the power of the cleartool command line utility. Cleartool uncovers all complexity but due to its nature it takes a steady pace at the keyboard and no nearsight problems because after one hour looking at white on black charcters thing might be come hazy. But there is c# to the rescue. With a small tool and a Commad line Interactor class I managed to make a tedious job in Clearcase a smooth ride. If you are a developer interested in an example of Process and ProcessInfo class and how to send and receive charcters to that process just <a href="http://213.84.140.132/topic.aspx?id=8">watch my video.</a></p><p>If you want to experiment with the class you can find the <a href="/UserFiles/Rene Schrieken/File/Code/activityreader.zip">code</a> here.</p><p><font color="#0000FF" size="2" face="Courier New"><font size="4"><font size="2" face="Courier New">[UPDATE: The Code is now in a zip file, hopefully this will work]</font></font></font></p>
