I wasn't a great singer but performing before a audience of 700 enthousiastic parents, grandmoms and granddads always thrilled me. However on stage I wasn't only getting in to the play (and foremost my role) but more on the technical things happening. Lights, microphones, the curtains, the way the scenary was put up. And still when I'm in a theatre I'm not only looking at the play or the comedian but still looking for how the ligth plan has beem implemented, how some special effects are created.</p><p>When you are at big events like TechEd and PDC a lot things of go on behind the scenes. And here also my eyes are inspecting the way the technical where abouts are being put together. Cameras, Light show, overhead projector, switchboxes, wireless microphones (asthonisching to see that those don't interfer with the WiFi network, bothways). That there is a lot of cabeling is understandable but at our Starbucks location I start wondering if the network will meet the SLA of 95% up-time...</p>
