<p>Yesterday I drove with my rented VW Rabbit to the <a href="http://www.nops.gov/samo" target="_blank">visitor centre</a> of the Santa Monica Mountains in Thousands Oaks. The lady at the desk provided me with the maps for the different areas and the well ment advice: be aware of the mountain lion. She didn't mentioned the Poison Oak and the rattle snake though.</p><p>I picked 'the waterfall' as my destination. Water is a problem in California so I shouldn't expect much 'fall' more 'drizzle', explained the desk lady. I took the car (somehow the visitor centre is in the middle of town, far, far away from the actual parks) and arrived ten minutes later at the car park. The Rancho Sierra Vista/Satwiwa park was home for centuries for farming and ranching.</p><p><img src="/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/rene.src/sn.jpg" /></p><p>After a hike of 2 hours I finally got to the 'waterfall'. Calling it a drizzle is offensive to drizzle. I would like to stick with 'drip'. The water dripped form basin to the other, several times.</p><p><img src="/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/rene.src/wf_5F00_sml.jpg" /></p><p>And that reminded me immidiately of our latency (but maybe also througput) issues of our prodcution server located in a datacentre in Silicon Valley. We ran several tests from The Netherlands and India but always ended up with complaints on the performance. We claimed the fast atalantic ocean contributed to this and now I confirmed. From West Holywood the performance is great. It simply takes too long for the water to reach its goal: The bottom of the canyon, enabling the plants, wildlife and trees to flourish.</p>
