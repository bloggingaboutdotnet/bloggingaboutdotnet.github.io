<p>I like challenges but this dive might be just too deep. If you're in for a laugh (or really think that I'm a nice guy) and you are around Amsterdam on june 13th (is that my lucky number?) come visit the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/netherlands/msdn/devdays/default.aspx" target="_blank">DevDays</a>. There I'll have my five minutes of fame, during the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/netherlands/msdn/devdays/speakers_talent.aspx">SpeakersTalent</a> competition.</p><p>You wonder why I'm scared to death? Somehow I entered the competition (in the jury <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/despos/">Dino Esposito</a> among others)requiring me to present in english. As you probably know by now, I'm not a native english writer, nor a native english speaker.</p><p>I'm going to practice my pronounciation for the rest of the weekend but I realize my chances for victory are slim.</p><p>CU on wednesday, june 13th between 12:00 and 13:00, at the Launch Auditorium in the RAI, Amsterdam :-)</p>
