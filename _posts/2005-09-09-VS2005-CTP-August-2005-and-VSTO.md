<p>I promised you a lot and realize not much came true.</p><p>But I really had some headache with the latest CTP. On my laptop I was confronted with the haunted keyboard problem. The keys for delete, backspace, cursor etc were not functioning in the code editor window. And there was an annoying message each time I closed VS2005: Cannot save the .sett.ings file.</p><p>To get things working I installed VS2005 on my project desktop which disabled the opportunity to do any work on the presentation during the evenings or weekend.</p><p>Luckily I was able to create a presentation and a working demo, with less functionality than I originally planned for. My impression was however that the attendees of my session where satisfied.</p><p>Here is the <a href="/UserFiles/Rene Schrieken/File/Presentations/miniTeched.ppt">presentation</a></p>
