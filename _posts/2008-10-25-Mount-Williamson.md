<p>With 8214 feet this days mountain will be the highest of my trip. Off course higher peaks are available (Mount Baldy being the highest) but I considered them either to far or to difficult yet to conquer. To get to the start point to need to drive the Angles Crest Highway to the parking lot at Islip saddle, just past two tunnels. Any further was not posible anyway.</p><p><img src="/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/rene.src/rd_5F00_sml.jpg" /></p><p>From the car park the trail named Silver Moccasin leads you in a moderate ascent with steep drop offs through low bushes and white fir and jeffrey pines (got that from the hiking booklet). Quickly you are up to some beautifull views across the San Gabriel crest.</p><p><img src="/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/rene.src/sg_5F00_sml.jpg" /></p><p>And this was only 2 miles in the trip. After the much needed water and sandwiches entered the system I was ready for the last stretch towards the summit and the steepest part of the hike. The pros for hiking at this altitude is the lower temperature which make you sweat less, the cons is the very much unpaved road. It needs some clever navigation to choose a path that is and doable and doesn't lead you to a dead-end (on a 200 feet cliff).</p><p>After reaching the top the views are much different when you look into easterly direction.
