<p>It worked out well. I'm on TechEd right now!</p><p>Unfortenately my wifi card is not working so I'm stuck with Dell pc's in the communications hall.</p><p>Currently I'm attending Writing Secure Code. I've been re-educated in DFD's again (that is Data Flow Diagrams) and our speaker states that you should always model your apps with that ancient modeling technic. I do not hope DFD's are becoming THE major design standard for microsoft and microsoft whitehorse because that will complicate OO/CBD development a little bit.</p><p>Saw some nice stuff on C++ with the SafeInt class. I never realized all problems with that (probally caused a zillion bugs in a project I tried to manage two year ago).</p><p>.Net security is somewhat dark magic and it didn't get any clearer but that has to change from next monday whem I'm back on the project. I think I'll have to change the complete security design ;-)</p><p>Session starting again.. have to leave.</p>
