<p>Ok, This is the first (and very early post from LA.</p><p>One tip if you come to LA from europe: Get a direct flight and select your cab driver carefully. We had a stopover in Atlanta and immigration to the US consists primarily of queus. A queue for immigration, three forms to fill out, finger prints taken, photo of your face (goes all in the database), a queue for getting you're suitcase of the conveyer belt. A queue for getting you're stuff back on the plane again. A queue for getting you fully X-Ray-ed (I'm fine, no disseases detected so far)</p><p>The young cab drivers here drive like crazy. We went from 65 miles to a full stop with 20 seconds several times during our 20 minute drive to the hotel. The driver squeezed his cab several times into gaps my bike wouldn't fit in.</p><p>On checkin of the Hilton/Universal City we upgraded our stay with breakfast so that adds $35 a day to our bill. This gives the pleasure of eating in the Executive lounge which is on the same floor as oir room (21st to be exact). I have seen a comment about the all expenses trip. I hope I can reclaim the taxi ($60) and the breakfast. I think it won't be a prolem because the company probably doesn't want me to starve to death.</p><p>Now about the PDC: Sessions will not start unitl 10am. I will follow pre conference track PRE004: Building .Net Web Services Today with .NET 2.0 and WSE 3.0. I already got my PDC t-shirt and a bag of goodies.</p><p>I'm going to finish my Starbucks Capuchinno ($3, also goes on the all expenses bill, ... d***n...forget to ask a receipt....you are my witnesses).</p>
